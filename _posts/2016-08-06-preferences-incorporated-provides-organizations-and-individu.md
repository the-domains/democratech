The **Democratech Conference** will be on **September 28-30th, 2017** in Peterborough-Ontario. The conference is aimed at strengthening democratic institutions and to grow in an industry worth $400 Billion by the end of this decade.

**Preferences Incorporated** is pioneering the 2017 Democratech Conference as an innovative event bringing together leading stakeholders in the Democratic Technology field. We aim to engage the Provincial and Federal levels of government, as well as Municipalities, and community-based organizations to inform and explore the use of these technologies. Both private and public sectors currently use decision-making tools, also called "Democratech" and some of those technologies determine important decision-making outcomes. The Conference will bring together scholars, business professionals and public servants to support growth in Democratech for decision-makers, community organizations and engaged citizens.

Preferences Incorporated provides organizations and individuals with research methodology support, knowledge development, and next practices. Our average return on investment for our clients is 3000%.
