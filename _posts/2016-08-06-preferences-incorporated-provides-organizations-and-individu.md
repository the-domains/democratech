  Preferences Incorporated is pioneering the 2017 Democratech Conference as an
  innovative event bringing together leading stakeholders in the Democratic
  Technology field. We aim to engage the Provincial and Federal levels of
  government, as well as Municipalities, and community-based organizations to
  inform and explore the use of these technologies. Both private and public
  sectors currently use decision-making tools, also called “Democratech” and
  some of those technologies determine important decision-making outcomes. The
  Conference will bring together scholars, business professionals and public
  servants to support growth in Democratech for decision-makers, community
  organizations and engaged citizens.
