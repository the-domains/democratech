PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES

Thank you for your interest in partnership, we are excited to collaborate with you!

As a partner of Preferences Incorporated's pioneering 2017 Democratic Technologies Conference you are able to choose how, in what areas and to what commitment level you work with us. By partnering with us, you have the unique opportunity to join an innovative initiative in the emerging Democratic Technology field and work with us as we engage the Provincial and Federal levels of government, as well as Municipalities and community-based organizations. Both private and public sectors use decision-making tools and the most important ones determine decision-making outcomes in our government. The Conference will bring together proponents of these technologies, clientele, decision-makers, engaged community members and organizations.
